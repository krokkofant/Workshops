    "As we previously mentioned, the state of a qubit can be represented as a point (vector) on the Bloch sphere. Different points on the sphere represent different qubit states. Therefore, it is rather intuitive to think that in order to modify the state of a qubit, we need a way of moving the point (vector) on Bloch's Sphere. \n",

    "Movements within a sphere can be done by rotating the vector defined by the point. Mathematically, the rotation of a vector can be achieved using rotation matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classical computers manipulate bits using classical logic gates such as OR, AND, NOT and NAND. Similarly, quantum computers manipulate qubits using quantum gates . The gates are applied to qubits and the states of the qubits change depending on which gate is applied. In the Bloch sphere representation, the gate provides instructions for rotating the qubitâ€™s vector around the sphere. Hence, a gate is represented by a matrix, in particular in order to be consider a gate, the matrix most be unitary and have the same number of input and output qubits.\n",

    "The hardware implementation of quantum gates depends on how the qubit and quantum computer has been implemented technologically. Quantum gates and quantum circuits are the way we program quantum computers to do things. When designed to solve a specific problem, then they are the graphical representations of a quantum algorithm. They are read from the left to the right. On the very left, the individual qubit. From there on to the right, there is a line, called a wire, that describes the evolution of the qubit during computation. On this wire, one can apply operations, by means of quantum gates. After running a quantum circuit, the result is retreived by measuring the qubit. As we mentioned before, when measuring the qubit we only get a yes or no answer, but the answer we get depends on how the probability amplitudes were evolved, how the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ changed throughout the wire.\n",
